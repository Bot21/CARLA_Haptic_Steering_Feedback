# CARLA_Haptic_Steering_Feedback

CARLA driving scenario with Logitech steering wheel control for the testing of haptic feedback and third-eye technologies. This project is a progression of the original work by Calleon3: https://github.com/Calleon3/Carla-Logitech-G27-Driving-Scenario

There are two folders: 'Experimental Version' and 'Stable Version'. The latter contains versions of the scenario that have been tested to work, while the experimental folder contains those that are a work-in-progress and may have some unresolved bugs. In particular, 'CARLA_Haptics_v2.3_documented_untested.py' is an untested full build with the most recent features and comments. The rest in the experimental folder are dedicated scripts used to develop and test individual features of the build.

## New Features

- New vehicle following behaviour + visual trajectory guidance
